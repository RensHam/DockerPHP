# Docker setup

A complete PHP docker set with all required element to develop a php application.

Comes with:

 - PHP 7.2
 - Mariadb with tmpfs allowing to run intergration test at warp speed
 - Mariadb where the data is saved over runs the development enviroment
 - NPM instance with node, yarn, webpack allowing to process the es-6 and scss scripts
 - Nginx as server on port 8080

# Installation

Install docker ce and run 

```bash
name = <PROJECT NAME>
sudo -E docker-compose build --build-arg SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$(< path to ssh  key)"
```

# Running 

```bash
sudo -E docker-compose up
```

## Services exposed outside your environment ##

You can access your application via **`localhost`**, if you're running the containers directly, or through **``** when run on a vm. nginx and mailhog both respond to any hostname, in case you want to add your own hostname on your `/etc/hosts` 

Service|Address outside containers
------|---------|-----------
Webserver|[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Hosts within your environment ##

You'll need to configure your application to use any services you enabled:

Service|Hostname|Port number
------|---------|-----------
php-fpm|php-fpm|9000

# Docker compose cheatsheet #

**Note:** you need to cd first to where your docker-compose.yml file lives.

  * Start containers in the background: `docker-compose up -d`
  * Start containers on the foreground: `docker-compose up`. You will see a stream of logs for every container running.
  * Stop containers: `docker-compose stop`
  * Kill containers: `docker-compose kill`
  * View container logs: `docker-compose logs`
  * Execute command inside of container: `docker-compose exec SERVICE_NAME COMMAND` where `COMMAND` is whatever you want to run. Examples:
        * Shell into the PHP container, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bash`
        * Run symfony console, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bin/console`
        * Open a mysql shell, `docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -pCHOSEN_ROOT_PASSWORD`

# Recommendations #

It's hard to avoid file permission issues when fiddling about with containers due to the fact that, from your OS point of view, any files created within the container are owned by the process that runs the docker engine (this is usually root). Different OS will also have different problems, for instance you can run stuff in containers using `docker exec -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) CONTAINER_NAME COMMAND` to force your current user ID into the process, but this will only work if your host OS is Linux, not mac. Follow a couple of simple rules and save yourself a world of hurt.

  * Run composer outside of the php container, as doing so would install all your dependencies owned by `root` within your vendor folder.
  * Run commands (ie Symfony's console, or Laravel's artisan) straight inside of your container. You can easily open a shell as described above and do your thing from there.
